# LegoCSS Library

## Introduction

The name is slightly cheesy and obvious. I'm a LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> fan and have been ever since childhood. With reusable pieces of code, I can make larger components just like using LEGO<sup>&reg;</sup> bricks to make a castle.</p>

When first learning programming I used Twitter Bootstrap and Material Design libraries. The CSS libraries made creating a website painless and easy. On the downside, there was a considerable amount of code that came along that would never be used. I would spend countless hours rewriting specific styles to my liking. When I started doing this for every project I noticed how much time I was wasting. That is how this project was born.

## Demo
