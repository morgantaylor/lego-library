# LegoCSS Library

## Introduction

The purpose of this LegoCSS Library is to function as a very small component library that you can use in your projects. I was tired of linking to massive style libraries like Boostrap and Angular Material that are, of course, well written, but have far too much code for what I need. This is a slimmed down version of what I felt was important in a component library with my personal style and tweaks baked in.

## Demo

View the full documentation and demo to see the components in action. The showcase provides a full list of component examples, code snippets and demos of each.
